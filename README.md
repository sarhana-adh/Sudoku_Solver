# Sudoku_Solver

The program demo above shows how the Sudoku Solver works. In the beginning there is a placeholder problem, that is solved when you click on the button labeled "Solve Puzzle."

You may erase any numbers and plug in your own to find the solution for any solvable Sudoku problem. The video above demonstrates the solving of Placeholder Puzzle as well as an example problem and solution I got from the internet, so I would be able to compare the solution.

Concepts used: Backtracking and Recursion
